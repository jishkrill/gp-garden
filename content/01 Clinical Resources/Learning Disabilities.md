## Learning Disability Annual Health Checks and Health Action Plans

Really useful resource from Remedy:BNSSG ICB 
[Resources for Learning Disability Annual Health Checks and Health Action Plans](https://remedy.bnssg.icb.nhs.uk/adults/learning-disabilities/resources-for-learning-disability-annual-health-checks-and-health-action-plans/)

The above resources has lots of excellent resources and is a little bit overwhelming. The most useful for now are the following;
- [AHC Minimum Requirements under the DES](https://remedy.bnssg.icb.nhs.uk/media/6031/des-minimum-requirements.docx)
- [How to Complete an Annual Health Check](https://remedy.bnssg.icb.nhs.uk/media/atbjmzk4/how-to-complete-an-annual-health-check-jan-2024-002.pdf)  BNSSG specific PowerPoint but as a PDF (29 pages)
	- Page 16 - useful signposting for Epilepsy Annual review check list
	- Page 17 - useful refreshers of screening programs
	- Page 26 - Syndrome specific blood tests and considerations
- [Syndrome specific checks](https://remedy.bnssg.icb.nhs.uk/media/rhnh00ln/syndrome-specific-check-at-ahc-002.pdf)

Possibly useful PDF to get practice to print / send out prior to appointment,  18 pages but in Easy Read format.   Could potentially be a good QIP
[Healthwatch BNSSG LD AHC Checklist to send / give to patients prior to health check](https://remedy.bnssg.icb.nhs.uk/media/rsidsglt/healthwatch-bnssg_ld-annual-health-check_checklist_april_2024.pdf)
