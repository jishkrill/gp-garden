## Quick Reference
[PCDS treatment pathway](https://www.pcds.org.uk/files/general/Psoriasis-Pathway-2022-Update-web.pdf), visual summary easy to follow, differs slightly to NICE Guidance - good guidance on when to use coal tar and salicylic acid to reduce scale

Consider using validated scoring system e.g. DLQI, The average completion time of the DLQI is two minutes

[Link to cardiff.ac.uk page](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/medicine/resources/quality-of-life-questionnaires/dermatology-life-quality-index) where questionnaire was developed (annoyingly can only download questionnaire in a zip file)

The DLQI has also been turned into an app, could send to patients as ask to reply with the score. [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.ac.cardiff.dlqi&hl=en_GB) [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dlqi-the-official-app/id1576503015)
