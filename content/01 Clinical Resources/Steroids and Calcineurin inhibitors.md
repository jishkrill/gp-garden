Some tips picked up from BGPERT teaching 

## Steroids
General tips
- Consider two strengths of steroids for "face and flexures" and "body and limbs"
- Ointments preferable as fewer additives
- Steroid or Emollient any order as long as there is a gap. 
- Use an appropriately potent steroid. 

How to use
- Use daily for 2/52 or until completely switched off (up to one month max)
	- Then alternate days for 2/52
	- Can use maintenance of 2x / week (weekend therapy) for a further few months

If need a lower allergy preparation steroid - Synalar maybe helpful

## Calcineurin inhibitors

- Can be used twice daily and weaned down to twice weekly maintenance
- Elidel (Pimecrolimus) cream can be used from age 3/12 - BNF licence from 2 years
- **Leave at least 1 hour either side of application before applying moisturiser**
- Not generally used in acute therapy as they sting.
- Warn that patient may experience warmth / burn on application - **WARN Patient**
- Possible alcohol reaction - patchy urticaria reaction
- **Useful as maintenance therapy**
