- Important takeaway is that erectile dysfunction is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  
- It can be quite tricky as it is a consultation where there is often an agenda mismatch from the start. 
- Remember new evidence and guidance to do a testosterone test in all men (fasting between 9-11am) as PED5i drugs may not work in testosterone deficiency

- In brief "Patients should be exposed to a minimum of 4 (preferably 8) of the highest tolerated dose of at least 2 drugs (taken sequentially, not concurrently) with adequate sexual stimulation"

## Patient information 

[British association of urological surgeons website PIL](https://www.baus.org.uk/patients/conditions/3/erectile_dysfunction_impotence)

[British association of urological surgeons leaflet on sildenafil to sent out to patients (pdf)](https://www.baus.org.uk/_userfiles/pages/files/Patients/Leaflets/Viagra.pdf)
Very good but quite in-depth leaflet including 'homework' for patients from CWNL (Central and North West London) Better Sex Leaflets  ["worried about staying hard"](https://www.sexualhealth.cnwl.nhs.uk/media/1055/worried.pdf)

## Further Reading
The 2017 full guideline from the BSSM (British society of sexual medicine) https://bssm.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BSSM-ED-guidelines-2018-1.pdf is excellent reading but it is 28 pages long.
Bits I found particularly interesting.
- Table 2 (page 4) for Metabolic equivalents to sexual activity
- Depression and ED statement (page 6) "suggesting that depression is a likely consequence of ED"
- Lifestyle Modification (page 8) - probably the most important section given the association with CVD. 
- Figure 2 (page 9) for guidance on testosterone screening
- Table 9 (page 12) drugs that may contribute to erectile dysfunction
- Daily Tadalafil and LUTS (page 17) - interesting but not currently recommended by NICE 

Interesting paper about antihypertensive and erectile dysfunction
