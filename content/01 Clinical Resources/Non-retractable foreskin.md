## Quick Reference

**Copied verbatim from page 5 of [RCS commissioning guideline](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/-/media/Files/RCS/Library-and-publications/Non-journal-publications/Foreskin-Conditions--Commissioning-Guide.pdf) on foreskin conditions**
The proportion of partially or fully retractable foreskin by age is:

| Age           | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|
| Birth         | 4%         |
| 6 months      | 20%        |
| 1 year        | 50%        |
| 3 - 11 years  | 90%        |
| 12 - 13 years | 95%        |
| 14+ years     | 99%        |
