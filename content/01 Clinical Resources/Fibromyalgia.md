## Patient resources for signposting.
N.b i've looked at these websites and most seem to require some financial committment. 
the sirpa.org page on fibromyalgia treatment is a good overview to sent to patients but their course is Â£200.  Livingproof seem to have a good directory of resources.   These resources were suggested on the Resilient GP facebook group
