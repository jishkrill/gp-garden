# Patient information
Remember that NICE suggest "A low FODMAP diet should be should be supervised by a trained dietitian and FODMAPS reintroduced according to tolerance after a limited period of restriction".  However local provision of dietician services may vary.  

Privately patients may wish use the [BDA (The Association of UK Dieticians) find a dietician](https://www.bda.uk.com/find-a-dietitian.html)page

For self management I primarily signpost people to the [Monash University website for FODMAP advice](https://www.monashfodmap.com/ibs-central/i-have-ibs/starting-the-low-fodmap-diet/), I warn patients that it is a paid resource but relatively low cost.
[Monash LowFODMAP App](https://www.monashfodmap.com/ibs-central/i-have-ibs/get-the-app/) costs £5.60 for Android £7.99 for Apple

[UK based IBS Network have some useful free resources](https://www.theibsnetwork.org/the-self-care-programme/) including a [summary page about FODMAPs](https://www.theibsnetwork.org/diet/fodmaps/) but  try to push people towards their paid IBS Self-Care Programme for a onetime fee of £24 (online access) / £36 (paper copy) 

[BDA (The Association of UK Dieticians) have a useful brief summary of dietary advice](https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/irritable-bowel-syndrome-diet.html)
