## Quick Reference 
My current quick reference sources for palliative care is this locally produced book. 
[The Palliative Care Handbook - A Good Practice Guide 9th Ed, 2019, Wessex Palliative Care Physicians](https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/for_clinicians/departments_ruh/palliative_care/documents/palliative_care_handbook.pdf)

Page numbers from the above source
Page 11 - Opioid conversion diagram (n.b some other sources use different conversions for oxycodone)
Page 12 - Opioid conversion chart
Page 48 - Seizures in pallative care
