## Quick Reference
Check if you have a local pathway but I find [this pathway from what0-18](https://www.what0-18.nhs.uk/application/files/2216/2920/1452/CS52646_NHS_Bronchiolitis_Pathway_Primary_and_Community_Care_April_21v2_2.pdf) very easy to follow,  I've linked it here as it often takes me about 90 seconds to find it on their website. 
N.b see also page on [[Useful Paediatric What0-18 Links]]

## Safety Netting
My local area in Bath has a [good leaflet](https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/patients/patient_information/PAE008_Bronchiolitis.pdf) that I use as it's local and suitable for printing 
I mainly use this [locally (RUH in Bath) produced leaflet](https://www.what0-18.nhs.uk/professionals/gp-primary-care-staff/safety-netting-documents-parents/bronchiolitis) that's also suitable for printing.

[What0-18 also have a good safety netting webpage (non pdf)](https://www.what0-18.nhs.uk/professionals/gp-primary-care-staff/safety-netting-documents-parents/bronchiolitis)
