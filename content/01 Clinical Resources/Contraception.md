## Quick Reference 
[UKMEC 2016 (Medical Eligibility Criteria)](https://www.fsrh.org/documents/ukmec-2016/)

[Link to contraceptionchoices.org](https://www.contraceptionchoices.org/contraceptive-methods) - most useful free resource now SexWise has shut down

[Patient information translated to other languages.](https://www.sandyford.scot/sexual-health-services/contraception/community-languages-contraception-leaflet/)

Possibly useful website to send out to patients to help find local sexual health clinics
https://sxt.health/uk/

[Useful missed pill calculator](https://thelowdown.com/missed-pill-calculator) from thelowdown.com website

## Commentary 
I used to use the website sexwise.org which was run by the family planning association.
The family planning association leaflets are the gold standard but are now behind a paywall.
Contraceptive choices is run by UCL and whilst not quite a slick or young person friendly as SexWise it's free.
