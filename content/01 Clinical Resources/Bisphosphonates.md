## Steroids and risk 
[Copied verbatim (Feb '24) from NOGG Full Guideline Section 7](https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/section-7-strategies-management-osteoporosis-and-fracture-risk#glucocorticoid)
16. Because bone loss and increased fracture risk occur early after initiation of oral glucocorticoids, bone-protective treatment should be started in the following people, at the same time as glucocorticoid therapy without waiting for bone density assessment, which should follow later **(Strong recommendations)**:

	1. anyone with a prior fragility fracture,
    2. women age ≥70 years,
    3. postmenopausal women, and men age ≥50 years, prescribed high doses of glucocorticoids, i.e., ≥7.5 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent over 3 months (N.B., this is equivalent to ≥30mg/day of prednisone for 4 weeks over 3 months)
    4. postmenopausal women, and men age ≥50 years, with a FRAX probability of major osteoporotic fracture or of hip fracture exceeding the intervention threshold.
