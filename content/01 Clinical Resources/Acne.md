## Quick Reference
I find the Acne Pathway from the PCDS the easiest to use for quick reference in a consultation.

## Further reading

- Full PCDS page on Acne
	- https://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/acne-vulgaris
- Interesting 2023 RCT on using spironolactone for acne.  ?could consider for those unable to have COCP.  Likely should be started by secondary care.  Check local pathways.

- I wonder if new Drospirenone POP will be studied soon as it's a derivative of spironolactone
