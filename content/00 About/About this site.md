This site is my own little [[Digital garden]].  

It's kind of like a personal wiki, where I'm collecting links to useful resources, pathways, guidelines, and learning that I stumble upon as I'm training in general practice.

The primary purpose is as a quick reference guide for myself and you may find some of the notes a bit spartan.

If you like what you see and would like to create your own personal wiki check out the [[Digital garden]] page for how this site is created and maintained.
