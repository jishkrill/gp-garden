# What is a digital garden?

I like this definition of a digital garden I found on google!
*"A digital garden is basically a combination of an online notebook and a personal Wikipedia. It’s your personal collection of ideas.
*‍Though they aren’t new, digital gardens are having their moment, growing in popularity across particular corners of the internet."*[^1]

# How is this site built?

A close friend (Henry) introduced me to the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I write my notes once in Obsidian and a [handy plugin ](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)converts my notes into a static webpage which is then hosted with a free web-hosting service called  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

This method seems ideal as it reduces duplication of work.  Obsidian is excellent for creating links between pages and keeping things organised.  I also like the philosophy of [file over app ](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) touted by Obsidians' creator.

Apart from paying ($8 per month) to have my notes synced to my phone the process was free and easy to follow.

# Create your own digital garden

If you'd like to create your own you'll need a small amount of tech savviness, and I do mean a small amount.

1. Get obsidian https://obsidian.md/
2. Get used to writing in obsidian and using markdown - I found this markdown guide helpful https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
3. Get publishing - follow the instructions on this website to build and publish your first site https://dg-docs.ole.dev/
